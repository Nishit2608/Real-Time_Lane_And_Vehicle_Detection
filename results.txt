These metrics were computed on the BDD100K validation set after training the UNet model for 20 epochs. The relatively low IoU and 
F1 indicate the challenge of detecting narrow lane markings, while the high accuracy and low loss show overall pixel-wise prediction was strong.

Validation Loss: 0.0511
